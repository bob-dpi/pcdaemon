HARDWARE
   The Dual Pulse Generator provides two non-overlapping
pulses.  The width of each pulse, the offset between them,
and the period can all be set with a resolution of 10 ns.
Outputs include both pulses as well as inverted versions 
of the pulses.  The output might look something like this:
 p1p:   __|------|_______________________________|------|___
 p1n:   --|______|-------------------------------|______|---
 p2p:   _______________|----|_______________________________
 p2n:   ---------------|____|-------------------------------
With parameters:
 period   |--------------------------------------|
 p1width  |------|           
 p2offset        |-----|
 p2width               |----|

   The power up default is all pins highs.  After the FPGA
is loaded pins p1p and p2p go low and p1n and p2n go high.


RESOURCES
   A single configuration resource sets the pulse parameters.
All parameters are given in units of nanoseconds, although
the hardware actually has steps of 10 ns.

config: the period, P1 width, P2 offset, and P2 width in
nanoseconds.  Sanity checks limit the times to less than
10230 ns and to be positive.  The period must be greater
than the sum of the P1 width, offset, and P2 width. 
Setting either pulse width to zero turns off that pulse.


EXAMPLES
   # Turn off both outputs (both go low)
   pcset pulse2 config 1000 0 0 0
   # Give a period of 5 us, P1 width of 1 us, offset of
   # 1 us and a P2 width of 500 ns.
   pcset pulse2 config 5000 1000 1000 500


NOTES
   This peripheral was created at the request of Wes Laquerre
and was built to meet his specific requirements.
